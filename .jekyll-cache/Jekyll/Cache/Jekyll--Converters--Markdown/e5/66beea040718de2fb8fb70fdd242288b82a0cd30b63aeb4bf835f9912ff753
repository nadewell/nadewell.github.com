What tools are required?
——————————–</p>
<ol>
  <li>Computer PC/Laptop. HTML works everywhere so low spec pcs are also good.</li>
  <li>Code Editor like <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. I recomended VS Code as it is Open Source and It has various great features and plugins which I will discuss later.</li>
  <li>Any browser of your choice. For example, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> But i will recommend to use Google Chrome. Both has great dev tools which are helpful to play around html. You will see that later.</li>
